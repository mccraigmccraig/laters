# promisefx

an exploration of some other ideas for effectful programming with
clojure/script

## Usage

promises are nice for async programming, but they lose you some of
the niceties of blocking - stacktraces, threadlocals

there are other effects which some of the other functional languages
take for granted which we might want to use too

```clojure

```
